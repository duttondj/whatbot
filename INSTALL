GUIDE TO INSTALLING WHATBOT

This guide will be referring to a modified version of shades' bot called bitches.
I call it whatbot so as not to be confused between versions. It is still referred 
as bitches in the database models because I didn't want to touch that. 

SUMMARY:

This is an outline of what you will be doing in this guide.

- Install necessary gems.
- Set variables in .env
  * Change sqlite db location. You can run the db in RAM but it tends to get 
    cleared from memory within a few minutes on my system. Having a file may
	increase latency but it's much more stable.
  * Set location of heroku gallery (enabled but not used currently)
- Set help message in app.rb (line 107).
- Set quit message in app.rb (line 121). Currently it is "brb".
- Update links in lib/cinch/plugins/links.rb
- Configure help.html to whatever you need it to be
  * https://github.com/britishtea/bitches/blob/master/docs/HELP.md
  * !links is not in help.html
  * Media section is not in help.html
  * big_brother is not documented anywhere
- Finally get whatbot running.
- Configure big_brother if desired (I could never get it working though)



CHANGES:

These are things that I have added/changed from the original bitches circa 
December 2013 that will be included. I have other things in my version but 
have removed them to sanitize everything for a public repo.

- Updated !slang to use lib/cinch/plugins/urbandictionary.rb since original 
  plugin stopped working

- Added windchill calculator to weather.rb. You can remove this if you wish 
  as well as Tomorrow's forecast (tomorrows temps are always a bit off anyway)

- Added a reminder command. This involves lib/cinch/plugins/reminder.rb, 
  lib/cinch/plugins/a_reminder.rb, and reminders.csv. You can remove this 
  plugin if you wish, just be sure to remove its listing in app.rb in the 
  require section and in the c.plugins.plugins block (line 48) as well 
  as the help.html file (if you use that).
 
- I have also gone through the commits for bitches and implemented any that I 
  saw fit to add in. whatbot was forked from bitches on 20-11-2013.


INSTALL:

First, you will want to install some basic gems to help with the installation 
of everything else:

$ gem install rdoc
$ gem install dep

Go to in the directory where you have whatbot and run:

$ dep install

So what I have below is this list of all gems that are required by each plugin 
and cinch itself. This list is not definitive as some gems have dependencies 
not listed unless you try to install it. This list is included in .gems:

cinch -v 2.0.10
cinch-authentication -v 0.1.0
cinch-identify -v 1.4.1
data_mapper -v 1.2.0
dm-postgres-adapter -v 1.2.0
dm-sqlite-adapter -v 1.2.0
dotenv -v 0.8.0
google-search -v 1.0.3
filmbuff -v 0.1.6
httparty -v 0.12.0
json -v 1.8.1
lastfm -v 1.16.0
nokogiri -v 1.5.10
retryable-rb -v 1.1.0
rufus-scheduler -v 3.0.7
shortly -v 0.3.3
slop -v 3.4.3
urban_dictionary -v 0.0.2
whatcd -v 0.1.5
wikipedia-client -v 1.0.0
yahoo_weatherman -v 2.0.0
youtube_it -v 2.1.13

Remember, all of these gems will be installed after running "$ dep install". 
There is still one more gem you will need though, 

$ git clone https://github.com/duttondj/cinch-imdb.git
$ cd cinch-imdb/
$ gem build cinch-imdb.gemspec
$ gem install ./cinch-imdb-1.2.1.gem

This is shades' own version of cinch-imdb, forked by me to keep it frozen.
There exists one in the gem repo but it won't work for us.

After this, you will want to edit the .env file for the necessary info. You 
will need to get a last.fm api account: http://www.last.fm/api/account/create

You will also need to update the sqlite db location. Currently it is set as:
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:////home/user/whatbot/whatbot.db"
Update it to be where ever you want and yes, you need all of those slashes. Be 
sure to create an empty file first if there is none already! Also, if you do 
not wish to use SSL, simply delete the SSL="true" line and change the port 
number to 6667.

At this point, you might want to update some of the aesthetic things that I 
mentioned earlier in the SUMMARY.

Everything should be ready to run at this point. Open up a new screen session 
on your box and run in the whatbot directory:

$ ruby -I lib/ app.rb

You should see whatbot connecting to the network and then spitting out the IRCd.
It will take a moment for the bot to fully start up and reply back to commands.


ISSUES:

If something goes wrong, don't panic. Look at the errors. Chances are you will 
see something that resembles:

`require': cannot load such file -- youtube_it (LoadError)

or something similar. Just install that gem, in this example I would be 
missing youtube_it. If there is some other issue or just have a question, 
hit me up since I probably had the same issue/question too.

EDIT 2015/11/19: This document contains everything I know about this bot so if
you have any questions, I don't know if I can help. Whatbot is a real pain in
the behind but works great usually. Timeouts can screw up the nick but a simple
reconnect or by adding in a command like !nickfix can reset the nick to what it
should be. I think the version I have has some ghost commands it runs on startup
and even associates with Drone so that has fixed a lot of issues in the past like
when whatbot is trying to join an invite only chan that is controlled by Drone.
